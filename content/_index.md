## About me

Hi! I'm Earo, a `data[c("explorer", "storyteller", "toolmaker")]`.

I currently work in strategy & analysis at [Canva](https://www.canva.com/careers/data/). As a former faculty, my past academic portfolio can be found [here](https://academic.earo.me).

Outside of work, I enjoy 

* programming with R,
* playing tennis and switch games,
* sipping flat white and G&T.
