## About me

Hi! I'm Earo, `data[c("explorer", "storyteller", "toolmaker")]`.

I currently work as a data scientist in strategy & analysis at [Canva](https://www.canva.com/careers/data/). As a former academic, my past academic portfolio can be found [here](https://academic.earo.me).

Outside of work, I enjoy programming with R, playing tennis and switch games, and sipping flat white and G&T.
