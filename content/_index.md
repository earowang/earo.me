## About me

Hi! I'm Earo, a `data[c("explorer", "storyteller", "toolmaker")]`.

Currently, I work in data analytics at [Canva](https://www.canva.com/careers/data/).

Previously, I was a lecturer in data science at the University of Auckland. My past academic portfolio can be found [here](https://academic.earo.me).

Outside of work, I play tennis.
