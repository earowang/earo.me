I'm a lecturer in Data Science at the [Department of Statistics](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/science/about-the-faculty/department-of-statistics.html), the University of Auckland. I earned my PhD from Monash University, under the supervision of [Dianne Cook](http://dicook.org) and [Rob J Hyndman](https://robjhyndman.com). My research focuses on statistical computing and graphics, and data science. I translate research methodology into human-centered and data-centric [![R](https://www.r-project.org/logo/Rlogo.svg)](https://www.r-project.org) packages.

I'm an advocate for open and reproducible research. My research projects are structured in an opinionated way---an adapted form of [research compendium](https://peerj.com/preprints/3192/).

Briefly speaking, I turn coffee (mostly flat white) into code.
