## About me

Hi, I'm Earo!

Currently, I work in data analytics at [Canva](https://www.canva.com/careers/data/).

Previously, I was a lecturer in data science at the University of Auckland. I earned my PhD from Monash University, under the supervision of [Dianne Cook](http://dicook.org) and [Rob J Hyndman](https://robjhyndman.com). My past academic portfolio can be found [here](https://academic.earo.me).

Outside of work, I play tennis.
